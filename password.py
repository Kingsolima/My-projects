******************************
This file contains functions that evaluates the strength of the password based off of the length
and the number of groups used (lowercase letter, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols).
The functions used are:
1. count_groups(pwd) - Counts the number of groups used in the password.
2. password_strength(pwd) - Does The calculation of the strength of
the password using the length and number of groups used.

    Description: This function takes the string pwd (the password) Counts the number of groups
    (lowercase letter, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols) used in the password. If it uses
    any characters not in the groups it will be ignored.

    Parameters: pwd is the password that's going to be checked.

    Returns: It will return the integer of the number of groups used.
